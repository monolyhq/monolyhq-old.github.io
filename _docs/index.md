## Let's Talk About The Market

B2B communication and collaboration market is growing fast and its market size is projected to be worth $54 billion by 2023. Many companies from emerging startups to conglomerates began to use collaboration tools to facilitate internal communication from 2014. Definitely, those tools increase productivity by reducing emails and meetings, sharing the right files immediately and staying looped among teammates.

According to the strong demand in the market, IT giants such as Microsoft and Google introduced their own products: MS Teams and G Suite. More than anything else, let’s look at the fatest growing player, Slack. It got a $1 billion valuation in just 8 months after launching publicly in February 2014. It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange at the value of around $20 billion in June 2019. Its daily active user count has crossed over 12 million in Oct 2019. In addition to Slack, there are more than hundreds of collaboration tools and a few unicorns such as monday.com and Symphony. They are doing fairly well.

Recently they are aggressively extending to conventional public and private clients including banks, manufacturers, governments, hospitals, etc. while opening more sales offices in the U.S., Europe, and Asian countries. There are still enormous business opportunities. The market looks promising.

## Critical Problems Are Arising
When the service providers’ privacy policies are reviewed, there are critical problems to be concerned by the enterprise users. First and foremost, data privacy.  

The privacy policy of Slack literally mentions that “Slack may collect and receive user Data and other information and data in a variety of ways.”. It also says that “We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified other information for any purpose.”. Also, G Suite’s encryption whitepaper states that “Google authorizes only trusted individuals to have legitimate access to systems and data repositories containing user data, including the Key Management Service.”. The above facts mean that the service providers have vast access to the files stored in their own clouds and can monitor the users’ activities. 

## Enterprise Data Privacy Is Not A Joke

Enterprises should be strictly conscious of data privacy to avoid serious damage. 

Enterprise data including their communication contents and files must be stored safely at the server and not be accessed by third parties, even service providers.

Enterprises are also looking for better ways of internal and external communication with teams, partners and clients in strict compliance with company policies. For example, when it comes to collaboration in the conventional manufacturing industry, product design data, which are usually large binary files, and communication contents must be shared only among the interested parties. In other words, enterprise data including data themselves, user list and even traffic patterns should be kept from third parties including service providers and whoever else. 

All of those data should be shared only among the stakeholders safely and trustfully. If not, enterprise data would be leaked and exploited by competitors or others. Regardless of size or industry, such data leakage can be serious from declining revenue to a tarnished reputation or massive financial penalties. Data privacy is not a joke for enterprises.

## Why is this important?
The on-premise type service works only within a single enterprise so no further productivity that you can get by working with those outside of you company will be given properly. 

The SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) type one works fine to communicate with those from outside of your company: i.e., your company will be definitely vulnerable because of the nature of such services. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_IT">Shadow IT!!</a> We describe the root cause of this and how dangerous they are if the enterprises allow their employees to use and connect to such services in the next section.

Currently, no other option do the enterprises have these days so the enterprises have to choose only one or the other: Privacy or Productivity, not both.
