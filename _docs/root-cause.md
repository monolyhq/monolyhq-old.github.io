There are many conventional and arising types of communication networks to facilitate enterprise communication and keep data privacy. But all of them have intrinsic weaknesses to be used for enterprise communication and data privacy.

##	Indirect Networking: Client & Server 
As cloud-based communication services, those service providers collect and store usersâ€™ data in their own servers. All of the user data, contents, shared files, user information, user list, and meta data are stored and monitored by service providers.

### End-To-End (E2E) Encryption
As an add-on of client & server networking, E2E encryption ensures data confidentiality sent from one endpoint to another, which means that only end point devices of receiver and sender, not a server, are able to decrypt the data. However, its enterprise scalability is not yet assured. One of the distinguished players has developed a new solution for E2EE scalability, but it is still trapped in an old paradigm of communication network.

When it comes to enterprise communication governance, the administrator needs to monitor and store such data transactions in its own server for digital asset management. However, E2EE does not allow the administrator to do the mission. More than anything else, it is sure that E2EE service providers still keep user lists, data transaction patterns that must be sensitive to enterprise users.

## Direct Networking: Peer-To-Peer (P2P) But No Trust
Another alternative is the P2P networking, allowing users to connect and share files directly via the Internet without the need of a central server or service provider. However, it lacks a few critical capabilities to be adopted by enterprise communication service.

First, due to the absence of the responsible service provider, it is hard to maintain the service stable and sustainable. Also, the identity of participants in P2P network are not usually reliable and so are the data exchanged among the participants. Even worse, the location of data storage and the level of data dissemination cannot be controlled by the administrator. All these lead to the critical issues in terms of Trust. Enterprise needs more realiable and trustworthy information when exchanging data for the purpose of serial businesses internally and externally.

### Blockchain
Blockchain strengthens P2P networking by improving transparency and integrity of data transactions among peers. However, similar to the limitations of the P2P networking, Blockchain has critical problems originated from its open, decentralized and permissionless network. It must be inappropriate for the enterprise users to let unindentified participants in the network store the data on their infrastructure, Blockchain. In addition, Blockchain still lacks processing speed and capacity to handle enterprise communication data.

### On-premise
Still, a lot of enterprises and organizations adopt on-premise type of communication service such as a messenger and collaborative tool systems. This fits in where they want to keep their data under their control and do not want to interact with those from outside of the company/organization. However, the trend goes for the wider area of interaction including other companies and/or organization to get benefits from Open Innovation approach. (link the reference here)
### SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
Most dominant and cutting-edge services are provided in a form of SaaS. A and B are notably growing fast since broader communication and reducing cumbersome email are possible by using their services. However, this type of services are inevitably a kind of Shadow IT that the company's management would never allow for data security.
### End-to-end Encryption
Yet another alternative is end-to-end (E2E) encryption. However, the companies and organization would not be able to monitor their employees interaction which potentially include sensitive information and even confidential one. Furthermore, E2E approach is not scalable so it costs more than expected when you want to expand the service and make your employees using it proactively.
### Peer-to-peer Networking

### Blockchain
