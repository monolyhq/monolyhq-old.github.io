<!--In the previous page, we explored the existing approaches and their limitation. 

While the client & server model is common and easy, it is not proper for the enterprise users that the 3rd-party service providers may deal with the enterprise data. To minimize such risks, end-to-end encryptions were introduced; however, it lacks of scalability and leads to worse usability.

P2P networking model is an alternative in that no intermediary such as a service provider is capable of intercepting the user's data. However, it is not acceptable that the enterprise users rely on data exchanged through the network due to the lack of data reliability. Using Blockchain, users may trust the data integrity exchanged through the network but still they face challenges including performance and anonymity of server owners.

## Direct Yet Trustworthy Communication

Monoly guarantees trust technologically - not relying on the human individual's discretion - for the enterprise communication by leveraging the several cutting-edge technologies in conjunction with Monoly's patent-pending mechanisms. As a service provider, Monoly does not get involved in the enterprise user's data exchange loop while powering up the entire service trustworthy.

Trust in this notion can be elaborated as follows:

#### **Direct Networking: No Users' Data Is Stored On Monoly's Server**
Users' data refers to users' registration information, messages exchanged among the users, traffic patterns, links that they shared, etc. No such data will be stored on any part of Monoly's system and infrastructure since Monoly provides a way that users can communicate with others directly. Instead, we only seed, collect and deliver the mathematically secure proof data to guarantee that such data exchanged and shared among the arbitrary number of users are authentic and trustworthy.

#### **Trustworthy: Users Do NOT Need To Trust Monoly. Trust Technology.**
Authenticity of communicating servers guaranteed by nature thanks to the cutting-edge technology so you are fully confident who you are talking to. Therefore, users can interact with other enterprise users in the network freely at their own discretion without concerns of revealing their data to unrelated parties. Also, this is essential when introducing "Productivity" to enterprise users. Without it, bringing productivity to the users will never make sense.

#### **Data Controllability: At Customer's Own Discretion In Good Faith**
Monoly guarantees the point of the enterprise governance: only the communicating enterprises take full capabilities of controlling data. No other parties get engaged in the way of their communication and collaboration. This is the different principle from those of services providing "going dark" style encryption and information concealment. We grant data control to those who are eligible to.

## Still Fast And Responsive Service
Guaranteeing the trust among an arbitrary number of users costs a lot systematically. Especially, such trust involves complicated consensus procedures which in turn make the entire network and system sluggish. Without breaking the limits, it would not be possible to provide the real-time communication services to enterprises.

Monoly is not bounded by the performance caused by the forementioned consensus procedures but it still keeps the same level of trust. All information and data that users want to share with the selected parties, will be delivered at the speed and throughput of the underlying network, server and storage that users operate. No unnecessary performance demerit comes into the play in Monoly service at the cost of trust. 

In other words, Monoly gives you full capacity of network as before while enhancing the entire service with full trust that users experienced never before.

## Highly scalable with trust
In the traditional client-server architecture, all data traffics flow into the servers that the service providers operate in this context. Accordingly, not only to scale out the service but to protect it securely, the service providers spend a huge amount of budgets and charge it. 
Traditional client-server networking model spends a huge amount of budgets to keep the system scalable. This is because all traffics need to concentrate on the service provider's system and 

Monol is highly scalable thanks to the information forwarding safty mechanism.
